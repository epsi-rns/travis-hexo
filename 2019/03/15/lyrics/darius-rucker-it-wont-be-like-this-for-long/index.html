    <h1>Darius Rucker - It Won't Be Like This for Long</h1>
<strong>March 15, 2019</strong>

<p><em>Dear Angel,</em></p>

<p>He didn’t have to wake up<br>He’d been up all night<br>Laying there in bed listening<br>To his new born baby cry</p>
<a id="more"></a> 
<p>He makes a pot of coffee<br>He splashes water on his face<br>His wife gives him a kiss and says 
It gonna be OK</p>
<p>It wont be like this for long<br>One day soon we’ll look back laughin’<br>At the week we brought her home  </p>
<p>This phase is gonna fly by<br>So baby just hold on<br>It wont be like this for long</p>


<p><em>Heaven holds a place for you.</em></p>
