    <h1>Scott Pilgrim vs The World</h1>

<p>Did you know that the original name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?</p>
<a id="more"></a> 
<p>You’d think it was because he looks like a hockey puck
but it actually comes from the Japanese phrase ‘Paku-Paku,’
which means to flap one’s mouth open and closed.
They changed it because they thought
Puck-Man would be too easy to vandalize,
you know, like people could just scratch off the P
and turn it into an F or whatever.</p>
