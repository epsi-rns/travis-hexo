    <h1>Susan Wong - The Way We Were</h1>

<p><em>Dear Angel,</em></p>

<p>Memories<br>May be beautiful and yet<br>Whatâ€™s too painful to remember<br>We simply choose to forget
<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Can it be that<br>It was all so simple then?<br>Or has time re-written every line?<br>If we had the chance to do it all again<br>Tell me, would we?<br>Could we?</p>


<p><em>Heaven holds a place for you.</em></p>
