  <div id="content">
    <h1>Every Day</h1>

<p>Iâ€™ve been thinking about this
over and over and over.
<a id="more"></a> </p>
<p>I mean, really, truly,
imagine it.</p>
<p>What does that
look like in a year?
In 10 years?</p>
<p>What will happen
to your life?</p>
<p>How alone will it make you?</p>
<p>How much is that gonna cut you
off from your family?</p>
<p>How much is that gonna cut you
off from everyone you know?</p>
<p>How will it feel for you,
almost entirely alone,
and not be able to explain to anyone?</p>

  <p><strong>Mind, body, and soul.</strong></p>
