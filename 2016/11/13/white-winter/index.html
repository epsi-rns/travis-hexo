    <h1>Surviving White Winter</h1>

<p>It was a frozen winter in cold war era.
<a id="more"></a> 
We were two lazy men, a sleepy boy, two long haired women,
a husky with attitude, and two shotguns.
After three weeks, we finally figure out, about <strong>css framework</strong>.</p>
<p>But we lost our beloved husky before we finally made it.
Now, every january, we remember our husky,
that helped all of us to survive.</p>
