Who do you think you see  
When you look at me

```haskell
-- Layout Hook
commonLayout = renamed [Replace "common"]
    $ avoidStruts 
    $ gaps [(U,5), (D,5)] 
    $ spacing 10
    $ Tall 1 (5/100) (1/3)
```

Well all I am  
is lonely just like you  
All I wanna do  
is have one dream comes true  
All I am  
is handing you my heart  
hoping to be part of you
