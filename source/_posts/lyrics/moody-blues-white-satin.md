Letters I've written, never meaning to send

<!-- more --> 

Nights in white satin, never reaching the end,  
Letters I've written, never meaning to send  
Beauty I've always missed, with these eyes before  
Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore  

'Cause I love you  
Yes, I love you  
Oh, I love you
