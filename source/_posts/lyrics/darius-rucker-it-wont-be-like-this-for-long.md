He didn't have to wake up  
He'd been up all night  
Laying there in bed listening  
To his new born baby cry

<!-- more --> 

He makes a pot of coffee  
He splashes water on his face  
His wife gives him a kiss and says 
It gonna be OK

It wont be like this for long  
One day soon we'll look back laughin'  
At the week we brought her home  

This phase is gonna fly by  
So baby just hold on  
It wont be like this for long
