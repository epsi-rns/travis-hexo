Now the fall is here again  
You can't begin to give in  
It's all over

<!-- more --> 

$$ \int_0^\infty \mathrm{e}^{-x}\,\mathrm{d}x $$

Will you think of times you've told me  
That you knew the reason  

$$ \lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0 $$

Why we had to each be lonely  
It was just the season
