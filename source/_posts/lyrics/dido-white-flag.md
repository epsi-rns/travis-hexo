I know you think that I shouldn't still love you  
Or tell you that

But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it  
Where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder  
Or return to where we were

I will go down with this ship  
And I won't put my hands up and surrender  
There will be no white flag above my door  
I'm in love and always will be
